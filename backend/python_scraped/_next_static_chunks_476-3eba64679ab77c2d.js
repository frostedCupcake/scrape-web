It represents an evolution from traditional on-premises data systems to a more scalable, flexible, and efficient approach enabled by the cloud. While the modern data stack offers robust data capabilities, it also has limitations.\\n\\n#### Technology adoption\\n“The future is already here, it\'s just not evenly distributed.”  ― William Gibson\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’ve probably heard this quote before. It’s almost a platitude in silicon valley, but it’s a good reminder that your reality is not necessarily shared by others. In major tech hubs, all we hear and talk about is the newest trends, and are generally uninterested in the old.\\nThis is great for building new innovative technologies, as it fosters a large dense market of early adopters. However, it’s important to remember that just because some technology is ubiquitous in San Francisco, it doesn’t mean that it is elsewhere in the country.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet’s take general cloud adoption as an example. AWS launched in 2006. Almost two decades later [a little more than half of enterprise IT environments are in the cloud](https://foundryco.com/tools-for-marketers/research-cloud-computing/) (vs. on prem), and only 13% of enterprises have a fully deployed multi cloud infrastructure/architecture. Although cloud (and multi cloud) environments are clearly the future, it takes a long time for this trend to “distribute evenly”.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, let’s look at the modern data stack, which consists of cloud-native data tools. Companies building products in the data stack have raised more than $220B in the last 4 years alone and the space has seen multiple decacorns reaching $500M ARR. Gartner estimates that data management is the largest infrastructure market and by 2026, it’s expected to grow to $200B and represent 32% of the total infrastructure market.\\n\\n\\n\\nClearly a lot of companies are buying a lot of cloud data management products, and if you’re somewhere like San Francisco, cloud data products (or the modern data stack) are considered industry standard by most. At this point, these tools may even be old news for some folks, as they start to look ahead to what’s next (e.g. [data mesh](https://www.datamesh-architecture.com/)). However this is not the reality that most others live in. It will take time to distribute evenly.\\nIn the following sections we’ll get into the specific shortcomings of MDS and reasons why MDS doesn’t replace the need for embedded analytics. Howevert, it’s important to remember that most companies cannot solve their data needs with a modern data stack becasue they simply have not fully adopted it yet.\\n\\n #### Mismatch between user & tools\\nThe evolution of the modern data stack (MDS) has generally made data operations easier, faster, and more reliable. For data practitioners and the business as a whole, the modern data stack provides a ton of benefits. However for the average employee not much has changed, they still don’t have access to data infrastructure, if they did they are unlikely to know the data well enough to navigate it, and if they had the needed access and context they’d still need to know sql (or python) – to be clear, the MDS is not just one thing, but nearly every component is designed with data professionals in mind, and would be very difficult for a non-technical business user to navigate.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a new wave of BI tools built for non-technical users now, but 1) adoption is still very early and it’s not clear how good these tools are, and 2) even if someone had clean controlled access to a tool like this, it still would be at a disadvantage to native analytics in the product(s) they’re already using. This leads to the next modern data stack shortcoming – users don’t want to context switch, and generally don’t want to adopt new tools.\\n\\n#### A company may have fully adopted MDS tooling, but that doesn’t mean it will actually be used widely in an organization.\\nAlthough MDS has made centralizing data & BI much easier for companies, the desire from users to access analytics in the tools they already use is unlikely to go anywhere. This is illustrated by the rise in popularity of reverse ETL tools, like [Hightouch](https://hightouch.com), [Census](https://census.com), and [Rudderstack](https://rudderstack.com), which sync data directly from a data warehouse to the operational systems used by your marketing, advertising, and operations teams (aka the SaaS apps they already use).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe adoption of reverse ETL tools suggests that most businesses still need to move data out of a centralized stack back out to the various tools that users actually use every day, since there’s a massive adoption advantage to having analytics within your regular tools. Not only is there no need to switch between apps but the user is also able to see analytics along with operational context. \\n\\n#### Resource bottlenecks\\nAnother issue your users or employees may face is dependence on internal data teams. The quality and availability of analytics depends heavily on the internal data team\'s expertise and resources, which can vary significantly. Data teams across industries have increased in headcount and efficiency (often thanks to adopting MDS). However, they’re still usually limited from both a resource and domain expertise perspective, which creates a bottleneck within most enterprises.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom a resource perspective, data teams have to deal with skill gaps and competing priorities. When data teams are the middleman between users and the data stack, all requests go through them. Top-level executives may have higher leverage when it comes to getting analytics requests handled quickly by an internal data team, but most users request’s will go to the bottom of the queue. At worst it may never get turned around, and even if it does there could be a delay of days to weeks, at which point the result may no longer be as useful or a decision has already been made.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom a domain perspective, data teams only have so much context and expertise. Data teams will usually have particularly good insight into their own business, but this doesn’t necessarily mean they understand marketing analytics or sales forecasting particularly well. They’ll never know the intricacies of how a specific organization (e.g. sales, HR, support, or product) works as well as the actual employees in that org or the vendors who serve that specific employee. The data team will also have a more shallow understanding of application specific data – they won’t know the details of how this data was created, stored, and processed, before it was ingested by them.\\n\\n\\n\\nEmbedded analytics does not face these bottlenecks. Analytics are always up-to-date (often real-time), and are maintained by the SaaS vendor who understands the entire lifecycle and lineage of this data. Additionally, the SaaS vendor has a deep understanding of their customers’ use-cases and best practices, plus they possess a wealth of data across their customer base. This allows them to aggregate and analyze data at scale, and to identify trends, benchmarks, and patterns that individual customers might miss. This domain specific knowledge and data enables them to provide targeted insights that address industry-specific challenges or optimize domain-specific workflows.\\n\\n #### Summary\\nUltimately, the popularity of the MDS is well founded and brings a number of benefits to data practitioners and the businesses they serve; however, it doesn’t exactly solve data access or analytics for the average user or employee. This is because it doesn’t provide a comfortable or familiar UX for most users, it doesn’t natively integrate data into a user’s existing workflows and context, and the insights themselves may be limited by the data team’s domain knowledge or expertise (or lack thereof).\\n\\n\\n\\nFor these reasons embedded analytics experiences that are carefully tailored to the end user will always have structural advantages. As a consequence, rather than replacing the need for embedded analytics, the MDS is actually complementary to and enhances embedded analytics.\\n\\nIf you’re a SaaS vendor considering embedded analytics, [book some time with Quill](https://cal.com/quillsql/30min).

As a result, customers’ expectations have risen dramatically.","date":"July 23, 2024","category":"Product","slug":"why-users-want-customer-facing-analytics","minutes":6,"content":"Due to low barriers to entry, abundant capital, and tens of thousands of ambitious founders, the SaaS industry has become one of the most competitive markets in the world. As a result, customers’ expectations have risen dramatically. Access to data and insights is no exception. A trend that has gained significant traction is the demand for customer-facing analytics, also known as embedded analytics. Users now expect that high-quality analytics features are seamlessly integrated into their SaaS products/product experience. Below, I outline the reasons users want customer-facing analytics.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Users want analytics where they are\\n\\n\\n\\nUsers crave convenience. They want seamless access to analytics within their existing workflows. Customer-facing analytics that are embedded within the platform they already use for their day-to-day operations reduces the product friction to almost zero. Data and insights are surfaced naturally as users take action in the application or are at most a few clicks away. By providing users with actionable insights without the need to switch platforms, customer-facing or embedded analytics not only enhances user experience by eliminating the need for users to navigate multiple tools but also ensures that users can make informed decisions faster and more efficiently.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### SaaS vendor’s domain expertise leads to novel data insights\\n\\n\\n\\nUsers want easy wins. They want analytics that are relevant, accurate, & actionable; and SaaS vendors are best positioned to deliver on this. SaaS vendors have unique advantages when providing analytics: 1) they deeply understand their use cases, users, and best practices; and 2) they possess a wealth of data across their customer base, allowing them to aggregate and analyze data at scale, identifying trends, benchmarks, and patterns that individual customers might miss. This domain specific knowledge and data enables them to provide targeted insights that address industry-specific challenges or optimize domain-specific workflows. Overall this expertise gives SaaS vendors the opportunity to provide the highest-leverage analytics that are perfectly tailored to their customers\' needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Optimal UI/UX for end-users\\n\\n\\n\\nUsers want products that are familiar and easy to use. When embedded or customer-facing analytics are well-designed, users can interact with data in a way that feels natural within the context of the application, leading to higher engagement and satisfaction. Just as SaaS vendors leverage their understanding of users, use cases, and best practices to surface the most valuable insights, they also have a significant advantage in providing the ideal UI/UX. By tailoring the user interface and experience to the specific needs of their users, SaaS vendors can ensure that analytics features are intuitive and accessible. This is especially important considering that most users are data scientists or analysts. While data professionals may prefer advanced analytics or BI applications, these tools are often not suitable for every user. Many important stakeholders—such as executives, managers, and business leaders— are non-technical business users that need insights to make strategic decisions but lack the expertise to navigate complex data platforms. Embedded analytics can provide the optimal UI/UX by offering familiar design patterns and aligning with users\' natural workflows.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Summary\\n\\n\\n\\nAs businesses increasingly rely on data to drive decisions, the demand for customer-facing analytics within SaaS products will continue to grow. When designed well, the vast majority of users will prefer customer-facing or embedded analytics offered within their SaaS product over specialized analytics tool due the the natural advantages SaaS vendors have: they can offer unparalleled convenience, leverage their deep understanding of user needs, and deliver an optimal user experience. In a competitive market, offering embedded analytics can be a key differentiator that drives success for both you and your customers."},{"title":"Why SaaS Companies Offer Customer-Facing Analytics","subtitle":"Just like the look & feel of analytics may differ, you’ll hear various explanations for why a specific company wants to offer customer-facing analytics","category":"Product","date":"July 19, 2024","slug":"why-offer-customer-facing-analytics","minutes":4,"content":"Just like the look & feel of analytics may differ, you’ll hear various explanations for why a specific company wants to offer customer-facing analytics:\\n\\n> “Customers are asking for it”\\n\\n“We need it to compete up-market”\\n\\n“The CFO holds budget for the renewal, and we need her to understand the value we provide, since she’s not a daily user of our product”\\n\\n“Managers want observability into how their team is using the product”\\n\\nBut in the same way analytics features boil down to the same primitives (charts, tables, dashboards, etc), the ultimate reason for offering customer-facing analytics almost always comes down to the same core goal: product usage and revenue. Embedded or customer-facing analytics are a tried and true way of doing this – nearly every successful SaaS company integrates these features into their products. Below I outline and explain exactly why SaaS companies invest in customer-facing or embedded analytics.\\n\\n#### Analytics = engagement = retention = revenue\\nAnalytics features create virtuous loops for software products: analytics features enhance user experience, which drives more engagement & usage, which creates more data, which drives more analytics usage.\\nLet’s take Stripe as an example. Stripe has various customer-facing analytics features: transaction analytics, subscription metrics, financial reporting & insights, risk & fraud analytics, API usage & performance metrics – nearly every product/product line has a corresponding analytics product/feature.\\nThese features give users a clear picture of how Stripe is functioning and allow them to measure the results of their actions. This not only improves user experience but also builds trust. As users see the tangible benefits of their actions, they become more engaged, leading to increased product stickiness. This engagement drives further usage of Stripe’s core products and promotes the adoption of adjacent products. As product usage grows, so does the volume of data managed by Stripe, making its embedded analytics features even more useful and valuable.\\n\\n#### Product expansion\\nAnalytics features don\'t just drive engagement for core users; they also attract adjacent user types. SaaS products like Salesforce and Jira are great examples of this, as they want to capture the attention of an entire department or function. Salesforce wants the entire sales organization, from individual reps to the CRO on their platform. Jira wants to engage the entire engineering and product organization, everyone from IC engineers to the CTO.\\nAs you move up the org structure, usage is driven more and more by analytics features (rather than the core product features). Sales managers are rarely adding leads or creating accounts themselves, but they do want to see pipeline, conversions, and review opportunities created by their team. Likewise, the CTO is generally not creating actual tickets in Jira or even taking action on them, but he does want to understand engineering velocity across teams or where there are bottlenecks in engineering.\\nAs you attract more user-types and serve more stakeholders across an organization, you become a platform or system-of-record for the organization. Accordingly, embedded analytics is a powerful lever that SaaS companies use to help them transition from a niche application to a system of record (SOR) – the holy grail for software companies.\\n\\n#### Product differentiation\\nAs businesses increasingly rely on data to drive decisions, the demand for customer-facing analytics within SaaS products will continue to grow, and companies that can provide actionable insights and valuable data within their platforms are more likely to attract and retain customers. Accordingly, customer-facing analytics are more than just a feature; they are a strategic tool that drives user engagement, expands product usage across different user types, and ultimately boosts revenue. By embedding analytics, SaaS companies not only enhance their value proposition but also secure a competitive edge in the market."},{"title":"Don’t build ChatGPT for X.

Some common examples of customer-facing analytics are charts & graphs, data tables, dashboards, reporting tools, or even self-service analytics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### What’s the difference between \\"customer-facing\\", \\"user-facing\\", and \\"embedded\\" analytics?\\n\\"User-facing analytics\\" and \\"embedded analytics\\" are generally used interchangeably with the term \\"customer-facing analytics\\". However, data folks that really care about this stuff will tell you that embedded analytics is a specific variation of customer or user facing analytics that’s defined by, \\"bringing data into familiar places to meet customers where they live, and encouraging curiosity with data that they would normally not be able or have time to interpret.\\" Overall the descriptors \\"customer-facing,\\" \\"user-facing,\\" or \\"embedded\\" primarily distinguish analytics delivered as a product (or part of a product) to end-users or customers from internal or business-facing analytics, where analytics are delivered via a 3rd party application to internal stakeholders within a company. Companies almost exclusively use business intelligence (BI), data science notebook, or data app tools – such as PowerBI, Looker, Tableau, Hex, or Streamlit – for internal use-cases.\\n\\n\\n#### Customer-facing, user-facing, and embedded analytics ≠ product analytics\\nCustomer-facing, user-facing, or embedded analytics should not be confused with product analytics (or sometimes called event analytics). Product analytics tools, like Amplitude, Mixpanel, or Posthog, may require implementing some frontend code, but this is invisible to end-users/customers, and the data/insights are used by internal company stakeholders. Specifically, product analytics tools enable product teams to ingest, process, and analyze user event and engagement data (e.g. conversion metrics, feature usage, active user count). Typically product teams use this data to improve and optimize their product experience."}]')}}]);
